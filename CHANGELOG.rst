.. _changelog-4.0.2:

4.0.2 - 2024-08-04
==================

Changed
-------

-   Exclude FRU sections when the associated ``include_*`` key
    has been removed from the ``[common]`` section. (#21)

    The previous behavior was to assume a section should be included
    unless the associated ``include_*`` key was explicitly set to false.
